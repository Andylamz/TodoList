## Why Use Class Structure?

While a simple to-do list can be implmented with basic functions and DOM manipulation,
this project was purposefully built using JavaScript ES6 class structure to practice:

- Object Oriented Programming
- Better code organisation
- Scalability for more features
- Separation of data logic and UI rendering
